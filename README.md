# Wave Engine

Wave Engine is a modern C++ game engine with a custom editor and a focus on clean, understandable systems.

The goal is to keep the codebase approachable, moddable and open to community contributions, without relying on heavy prebuilt UI layers or opaque engine stacks.

This repository contains the publicly shared build of the engine.
