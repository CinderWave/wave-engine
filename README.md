Wave Engine is a handcrafted C++ game engine focused on precision, control and long term maintainability.
Every system is built from the ground up, without prebuilt UI frameworks or shortcuts, allowing the engine to develop its own identity and workflow.

This repository is an internal build.
All code, systems and tools contained here are private and reserved for in-studio development only.
